\chapter{Design} \label{chapter:design}

In this chapter, we describe the design and algorithms that discipline the
operation of the Cluster Autoscaler and the Scheduler; we point out their
shortcomings concerning local data storage and propose design enhancements to
enable seamless scheduling and autoscaling with local persistent volumes.

\section{Design Rationale \& Goals}

As explained in section \ref{section:intro_problem_statement}, our goal is to
extend the Scheduler and the Cluster Autoscaler so that they operate seamlessly
with workloads that use volumes backed by local storage. More specifically, we
aim to:

\begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item Extend the Scheduler to consider the storage capacity of the nodes
            when scheduling Pods.
      \item Extend the Autoscaler to scale-down nodes where local volumes live,
            ensuring that Rok's mechanism snapshots the data before removing the
            node from the cluster.
      \item Extend the Autoscaler to check if the Pod's volumes can be placed on
            any other node (with regards to storage capacity) when evaluating (for
            a possible scale-down) if a Pod can be moved elsewhere.
      \item Extend the Autoscaler to consider the storage capacity of nodes, and,
            when scaling up, add a node with enough storage capacity.
      \item Extend the Autoscaler to not remove unready nodes in case local
            volumes live on these nodes.
\end{itemize}
