        \item Build Pod equivalence groups - each Pod equivalence group consists
              of Pods that are managed by the same controller (same UUID) and have
              the same spec and labels.
        \item For each node group registered:
              \begin{enumerate}
                  \tightlist
                  \item Get its target size.
                  \item If the target size $\geq$ max size, go to the next node
                        group.
                  \item Create a template node for the node group.
                  \item Compute the expansion option for the node group, see
                        \co{ComputeExpansionsOption()}.
                  \item If any unschedulable Pod can be helped by adding a new
                        node of the node group, add the node group in the expansion
                        options list.
              \end{enumerate}
        \item If there are not any expansion options list, then do not trigger
              any scale-ups.
        \item Else, from the expansions options select one, according to the
              configured expansion strategy.
        \item Execute the selected scale up option: increase the target sizes of
              the corresponding node groups.

                  \item Call the Predicate Checker to check if any of the
                        unschedulable Pods can be scheduled in the new cluster snapshot.
                  \item If the sample Pod fits the new node in the cluster
                        simulation, append all the equivalent Pods in the list of Pods
                        that got helped (\co{options.Pods}).

        \item Call the bin-packing estimator to estimate how many nodes of
              the node group would be needed to help all the equivalent Pods.
        \item Return the \co{option}: a struct that indicates how many nodes of
              the node group are needed and which Pods would be helped.
